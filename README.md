# YouTube Fake Loading Killer

This script is designed to block fake loading / interruption messages like
"Playback has been interrupted" that can appear when using an ad blocker on YouTube.

In some cases, the video stream itself is not actually stopped, but warning UI appears
and makes it look like playback has been interrupted.  
This script detects and removes those fake interruption overlays to prevent unnecessary playback stops.

The goal is to reduce false-positive interruptions caused while using ad blockers
and keep video playback running normally.

Please note that changes on YouTube's side may temporarily break this script.  
If that happens, I will do my best to update and adapt it as quickly as possible.
